# OEG FAIR Ontologies Assessment (FOOPS!)

Files created by script "https://github.com/oeg-upm/foops_documentation_scripts/ttl_transformation.py".
The source is always the TTL file, and the result is a HTML file and a JSON-LD file, both with the same name as TTL file.

The main page displays the tests and metrics created from the ttl_transformation.py process, which are stored in doc/test.
This main page is generated by "https://github.com/oeg-upm/foops_documentation_scripts/ttl_catalog.py"

The process to update any of the tests or metrics would be as follows. After modifying any of the existing properties in the ttl file of the test or metric, it is necessary to first run the Python script ttl_transformation.py and then ttl_catalog.py to ensure that any updated properties are displayed on the main page containing the list of tests and metrics. Both scripts can be found at https://github.com/oeg-upm/foops_documentation_scripts/.

In case it is necessary to add a new property to any of the existing documents, it is essential to include it both in the script ttl_transformation.py, where it should be included in the SPARQL query, and in the function that maps the query results to the template. For tests, this function is called ttl_to_html, while for metrics it is ttl_to_html_metrics.

Additionally, the test or metric template must be modified to include this property and ensure it is displayed in the HTML. In this Mustache template, the mapping is performed and an HTML file is created for each test. The tests use template.html located at https://github.com/oeg-upm/fair_ontologies/tree/main/doc/test/template.html. The metrics use template_metrics.html located at https://github.com/oeg-upm/fair_ontologies/tree/main/doc/metrics/template_metrics.html.

To include a new test or metric from the beginning, its necessary to create a ttl file with the same structure as the other documents and include it in its corresponding folder. For example, if you create the test NEW1.ttl, you need to create a folder NEW1 at https://github.com/oeg-upm/fair_ontologies/tree/main/doc/test/ and place the file NEW1.ttl there.

All test and metric IDs must follow the following structure:
https://w3id.org/foops/test/
https://w3id.org/foops/metric/

Therefore, for the example we are following, the ID would be: https://w3id.org/foops/test/NEW1

Then you would run the ttl_transformation.py script, which will generate the HTML file and the JSON-LD file for that test. Afterwards, you would run the ttl_catalog.py script to add this new test to the main page.

Currently, the structure of the TTL file required for a test is as follows:
