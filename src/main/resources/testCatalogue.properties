VER2.name=Ontology version IRI resolves
VER2.description=This test verifies if the version IRI resolves. The test will pass if there is a version IRI for the ontology/vocabulary (detected using owl\:versionIRI in the ontology metadata) and whether doing a request to said IRI returns a resource. \nThe test will fail if the resource is not found (404 response) or returns an error.

FIND2.name=Ontology prefix is found in prefix.cc or LOV
FIND2.description=This test verifies whether the ontology prefix is available in prefix.cc or the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) registries. \nThe test will pass if\: \n	1) there is a prefix declared in the assessed ontology, \n	2) the prefix is found in LOV or prefix.cc \n	3) if found in LOV or prefix.cc, the namespace URI associated with the prefix is the same as the assessed ontology URI (or preferred namespace URI)\nOtherwise, the test will fail.
